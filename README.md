Find out your attachment style based on your favorite songs

This tool is inspired by the research in _"Individuals' favorite songs' lyrics reflect their attachment style"_ (Alaei, Rule, & MacDonald, 2022), which demonstrates that people's attachment styles can be reflected in the lyrics of their favorite songs.
