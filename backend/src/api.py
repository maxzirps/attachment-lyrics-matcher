Home in Your Arms
I’ve walked through storms, I’ve braved the night,
Searching for something to feel right.
But every road kept leading me,
To the place where you’re all I see.

No need to question, no need to run,
You’re my shelter, my morning sun.
When the world feels cold and unsure,
You’re the calm I’ve been fighting for.

I’m safe, I’m whole, I’m free where you are,
You’re my constant, my north star.
No doubts, no fears, no need for alarms,
Because I’m always home in your arms.

Your voice is the song I hold deep inside,
The melody that quiets the tide.
Every heartbeat echoes your name,
With you, love’s a steady flame.

No cracks in the foundation we’ve built,
Every touch erases guilt.
You’re my anchor, my steady ground,
In your love, I’m always found.

I’m safe, I’m whole, I’m free where you are,
You’re my constant, my north star.
No doubts, no fears, no need for alarms,
Because I’m always home in your arms.

No storm could break what we’ve made strong,
You’ve been my truth all along.
Every moment, I choose you still,
A love unshaken, an unbent will.

I’m safe, I’m whole, I’m free where you are,
You’re my constant, my north star.
No doubts, no fears, no need for alarms,
Because I’m always home in your arms.

With you, I’ve found where I belong,
My heart beats steady, our love’s the song.
No matter where, near or far,
I’ll always find home where you are.
